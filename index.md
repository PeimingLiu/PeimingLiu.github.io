Hi! I received my Ph.D. from the 
[Computer Science & Engineering Department](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at 
[Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), advised by 
[Prof. Jeff Huang](https://parasol.tamu.edu/~jeff/).
My research interest are Program Languages and Static Analysis.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from 
[Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/). 
You can obtain my [CV here](https://peimingliu.github.io/asset/pic/CV.pdf)

I am joining Google after graduation and working on MLIR project.
